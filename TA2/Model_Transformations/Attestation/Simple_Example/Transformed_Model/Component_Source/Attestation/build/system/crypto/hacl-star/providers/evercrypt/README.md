EverCrypt is a cryptographic provider that combines [HACL\*](../..) and
[ValeCrypt](../../vale) into a unified library that supports CPU autodetection,
multiplexing (picking the best implementation for your platform) and agility
(one API for multiple algorithms achieving the same functionality).

EverCrypt establishes a strong abstraction boundary that serves as a
foundational layer for verified applications such as Signal\*, Merkle Trees and
miTLS.
