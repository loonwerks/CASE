Points of interest:

- Some C implementations also have verified vectorized versions optimized for
  Intel AVX and AVX2 using compiler intrinsics (there is no inline assembly)
- MD5 and SHA1 are provided for legacy purposes and backwards-compatibility
  (e.g. TLS applications); no particular effort has been made to make them
  efficient
- HMAC/HKDF only use ASM implementations if the underlying hash algorithm has
  one
