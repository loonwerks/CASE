/**
 * A test suite that provides the following functionality for unit tests:
 *  - Clears all registers bridges and ports before each test
 *  - Initializes the selected bridge and ports before each test
 *  - Finalizes the bridge after each test
 *  - Creates a new instance of the test suite class for each test
 *    -> NOTE: this is NOT the same as having a separate JVM per-test (or suite), but is useful for test-local variables
 *
 *  If automatic calls to initTest() or finalizeTest() are not desired, simply override beforeEach() or afterEach()
 *  methods to change the desired behavior.
 *
 * @param bridge the bridge being tested, see [[test_event_data_port_periodic_domains.Arch]] for potential values.
 * @tparam T the type of the bridge being tested
