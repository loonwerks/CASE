The AADL files in the CASE directory are included with the Collins CASE TA2 plugin.  
If you are running OSATE with the Collins CASE plugin, these files will automatically be included as Plug-in Contributions, and you will see duplicate package errors.
To prevent these errors, delete the CASE directory and its contents from the project.
