// Single sender multiple receiver Queue implementation for AADL Event Data
// Ports. Every receiver receives the sent data (ie broadcast). The queue
// operations are all non-blocking. The sender enqueue always succeeds. A
// receiver dequeue can fail and drop data if the sender writes while the
// receiver is reading. This situation is detected unless the sender gets
// ahead of a receiver by more than COUNTER_MAX. Since COUNTER_MAX is typically
// 2^64 (see sb_event_counter.h), this is extremely unlikely. If it does happen the
// only adverse effect is that the receiver will not detect all dropped
// elements.

// integer type). Since we are using standard C unsigned integers for the
// counter, picking a queue size that is a power of 2 is a good choice. We
// could alternatively set the size of our counter to the largest possible
// multiple of queue size. But then we would need to do our own modulo
// operations on the counter rather than depending on c's unsigned integer
// operations.
//
// Note: One cell in the queue is always considered dirty. Its the next
// element to be written. Thus the queue can only contain 
// SB_QUEUE_INT8_T_1_SIZE-1 elements.
