	-- A component that constructs plans/costs to be used for assignments.
	--	1) Receive KeepInZones/KeepOutZones/Tasks/RoutePlanRequests
 	-- 	2) Build/Maintain Base Visibility Graph (Euclidean) from KeepInZones/KeepOutZones
	--	3) Construct, and send out, a RoutePlanResponse which includes minimum path lengths from each 
	--     vehicle to each task and from each task to every other task.
	-- 	4) Construct, and send out, a response which includes minimum waypoint paths for each plan request.
